<p><strong>Whether you come to us directly or have been referred to us by your GP: In an initial consultation, we find out how we can help your heart. We take an hour for you. During this time, the first examinations can also be carried out.</strong></p>

<h2>How can you imagine an initial cardiological examination?</h2>

<p>After completing a few formalities at our <strong>reception</strong>, take a seat in the waiting room.</p>

<p>Together with our doctor, you will work out your <strong>medical history</strong>: a list of previous illnesses, operations, medications you are taking, but also risk factors to which you could be exposed. If necessary, the questions posed by your family doctor will also be discussed. Afterwards, a short <strong>physical examination</strong> is carried out to determine your general condition (pulse, blood pressure, weight and height).</p>

<p>This may be followed by the <strong>first diagnostic cardiac examinations</strong>, such as measuring your heart rhythm by means of an ECG, visualising your heart activity by means of a cardiac ultrasound and testing your heart activity under stress on an ergometer.</p>

<p>If possible, our doctor will <strong>discuss the findings</strong> with you directly after the examination. If further examinations need to be carried out or data evaluated, you will meet again at another appointment.</p>
